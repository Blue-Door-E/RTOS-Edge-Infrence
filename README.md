# RTOS Edge Inference — AI Smart-Glasses with On-Device ML

A portable, fully offline AI smart-glasses system that performs real-time machine learning inference on the edge. Built with a custom FreeRTOS firmware running on an ESP32-S3 for camera capture and an NVIDIA Jetson for GPU-accelerated gesture classification — all running locally with zero cloud dependency.

## Overview

This project combines embedded systems, real-time operating systems, and machine learning into a wearable that can recognize hand gestures and map them to arbitrary actions — skipping songs, taking photos, browsing content — all through a pair of smart-glasses connected to a portable Jetson compute unit carried in a fanny pack.

```

1. The **ESP32-S3 Sense** captures JPEG frames using a zero-copy DMA pipeline through PSRAM and streams them over a local Wi-Fi access point via TCP
2. The **Jetson** receives frames, decodes them, and runs a custom-trained ResNet-18 classifier on the GPU
3. Classification results are sent back to the **smart-glasses display** over Bluetooth Low Energy in real-time

The entire pipeline runs locally. No internet connection is required for core functionality. Frame-to-prediction latency is typically under 100ms.

## Key Features

- **Real-time edge inference**: Hand-gesture classification at ~5 fps with sub-100ms latency
- **Fully offline**: All processing happens on-device — no cloud APIs, no data leaves the fanny pack
- **Privacy-first design**: Biometric hand data is stored locally and never transmitted externally, similar to how Face ID keeps your face data on your phone
- **Custom RTOS firmware**: Dual-core FreeRTOS design with dedicated cores for capture and streaming
- **Zero-copy camera pipeline**: DMA transfers from camera sensor → PSRAM → TCP socket
- **Automatic BLE reconnection**: Robust Bluetooth handling with MTU negotiation and chunked writes
- **Active learning**: Optional frame saving for dataset expansion and model retraining
- **Portable**: Entire compute stack fits in a fanny pack with the Jetson and battery
